A-3 Loops
---------


        1 -  Basic blocks 2,  3 and 4 correspond to the  while-loop.

          -  A while loop is  nothing but  a  set  of basic  blocks  with conditional  control            
             transfer, the only  notable difference being a jump to  a block that
             has been previously executed (i.e. a backward branch).

        2  - A  for-loop  is only a  while-loop, with  the  initializer separated out  into an  initial basic  block,
             the  body of  the loop subsequently, the  increment part at the  end of the loop  body, and              
             the conditional jump back to the start of the loop.
