A-4 Arrays and Pointers
-----------------------


        1  - Just like  scalar initialization, it  is split from  the declaration
            and  included in  the procedure  body.
           
           - In  the case  of arrays,  the initialization is split into  multiple statements that assign values
            to  individual array  elements.

           - This  is to  remain consistent  with GIMPLE's one operation per statement policy.

            
        2  - As GIMPLE  can perform only  one operation per statement,  it cannot read  and write 
            to  array  locations at  the  same  time (as  array accesses  involve offset  calculation).

           - Thus,  these are  split into  separate read and write statements by introducing a temporary.

           
        3   CLOBBER statements are used for  address-escaped variables. It is an
            annotation  to  signify  that  the  scope  of  this  address-escaped
            variable has ended.
