#This repository contains all the assignments done in the course principles of programming languages.
#Content of Assignments in short is as follows:
#Assignment 1: Use of -fdump-tree-gimple command to create gimple file 
#Assignment 2: Use of -save-temps command to generate files with (.s),(.o) &(.i) extensions
and see content of each file with editior such as vim,gedit or notepad and objdump command to see content of file with .o extension.
#Assignment 3: Use of -fdump-tree-cfg-graph / -fdump-tree-all-graph commands to generate cfg files for particular .c file and use of command dot.Tpng filename.c.012t.cfg.dot -o filename.png to genrate the parse tree for the code.
#Assignment 4: Study of assembly code and drawing of stack diagram for it.
#Assignment 5: This assignment is based on OOP(object oriented programming).
#Assignment 6: This assignment s also of OOP but also contain use of turtle module to draw different shapes.
#Assignment 7: DIfferent types of exceptions are handle in this assignment using python programming language.
#Assignment 8: Paint Event is handle in this assignment using Tkinter module
#Assignment 9: This assignment contains two programs written in LISP programming languge. First program is to find element from list present at nth position & Second program is to find factorial of number entered by user.
#Assignment 10: This assigment contains database created using PROLOG programming languge for the information of student cource and department.
#Assignment 4(using g++): Contains main.cpp file having code for swaping of two numbers using call by reference. Also its assembly code file generated using g++ -S command & machine code containing .o file generated using g++ -c command.
